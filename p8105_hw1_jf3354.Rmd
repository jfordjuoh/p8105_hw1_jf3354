###PROBLEM ONE
##Creating the dataframe

library(tidyverse) 

set.seed(10)

hw1 = tibble(
    vec_numeric = rnorm(10),
    vec_char = c("My", "name", "is", "Judy", "and", "I", "am", "learning", "data","science"),
    vec_logical = c("TRUE", "FALSE", "FALSE", "FALSE", "TRUE", "TRUE", "FALSE", "FALSE", "FALSE", "FALSE"),
    vec_factor = factor(c("low","medium","high","low","medium","high", "low","medium","high", "low"))
  )
#  vec_numeric = 1:10, vec_numeric = rnorm(10) ?#

##Take the mean of each variable in your dataframe. What works and what doesnâ€™t?

```{r}
mean(pull(hw1,vec_numeric))
mean(pull(hw1,vec_char))
mean(pull(hw1,vec_logical))
mean(pull(hw1,vec_factor))
```
## The mean of my variable vec_numeric was -0.50.I was not able to calculate the mean of my variables vec_char, vec_logical, and vec_factor because the argument of these variables are not numeric. 

##Convert the logical, character, and factor variables using as.numeric. What happens, and why? Does this help explain what happens when you try to take the mean?

```{r}
vf <- factor(vec_factor) ##convert vector into factor

x <- as.numeric(vf) ##convert factor into numberic value

x ##print the numeric value

is.numeric(x) ##check if this is a numberic value. If so it will print TRUE in the Console

mean(x) #the mean is 2. 
```
